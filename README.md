### SpaceGame
 This is a top-down space shooter where the player pilots a spaceship and shoots asteroids falling from the top of the screen. The game features real-time action with increasing difficulty, requiring quick reflexes and accurate aim. Under the hood, the game uses ArrayLists to manage dynamic objects like asteroids, bullets, and explosions. Nested for loops are used for collision detection and updating multiple entities each frame, ensuring smooth gameplay and responsive mechanics. Designed as a simple yet engaging project, this game showcases fundamental programming concepts in game development such as object management, rendering loops, and interactive input handling.
